    <p>Facebook Gaming does take a few extra steps to stream. While the promotion is better on Facebook Gaming, the user-interface for viewers is less intuitive. Facebook Gaming also doesnâ€™t have the option to stream anything other than games at the moment (though there is Facebook Live). If you plan to play trendy games, it is generally better to play on a platform other than Twitch for a better chance of being discovered.</p>

    <p>It is harder for people to stumble across a new streamer on Twitch, but there are more potential viewers already on the platform. It is easy to switch your content and your topic, and you can stream almost anything without having to change your channel. If you are a variety streamer, play lesser-known games, or want to do something other than gaming, you may be better off on Twitch, Mixer, or YouTube.</p>
