        Ways to monetize

    <p>Okay, so let’s talk about how to monetize your stream. Now if you’re a partnered broadcaster, this is probably only gonna apply to you guys that work on platforms that give you this opportunity. Rolling advertisements live, while you’re playing, forcibly make your audience watch an advertisement. This is pretty straightforward, it’s up to you guys whether or not you want to do this. If you have a perk in doing so on the platform you’re streaming from.</p>

    <p>There are other ways to monetize. We talk donations, this is where we get into people providing you with the income that they make. They can donate to, let’s just say make a goal that you’re trying to hit to support you, to make you do something. There’s different ways to bring in income, bring in donations and incentivize support from your community. Now, there are setting goals to work toward equipment, or work toward responsibilities and that’s totally up to you. A lot of the live stream community, you’ll find, finds this to be a norm. There are a ton of streamers relying on their communities to bring in some kind of … Pitch in that extra support, put that foot forward to back them up and help them on their journeys of being content creators. You can’t expect anything, but sometimes just throwing a number out there can definitely push the envelope on the donation, on the purchase, to help you out.</p>
