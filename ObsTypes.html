    <h2>OBS (Open Broadcaster Software Studio)</h2>

    <p>To begin, we’ll start with OBS since it is one of the most standard broadcast software programs. OBS stands for Open Broadcaster Software Studio. On top of this software being free, it is also open source, so the code is open to the public. This gives developers the freedom to improve upon this software whenever they please.</p>

    <p>OBS has a simple installation process after which you will manually connect a Twitch, Youtube, or another streaming platform key. OBS will recommend a few settings after this and then you are free to stream.</p>

    <h2>Streamlabs OBS</h2>

    <p>Streamlabs OBS is ultimately an advancement of OBS with increased functionality. Streamlabs OBS is essentially the same OBS code revamped with a better user experience. This software is also free and offers an even easier installation process than OBS. Although this software is only available for Windows, you can get Streamlabs OBS Mac with Bootcamp.</p>

    <p>Once Streamlabs OBS is downloaded on your Windows, Streamlabs will pre-configure all settings and send you straight to the Dashboard. All that’s left is to link your streaming account, run the auto optimizer, add your stream key, and your set to stream!</p>
